An Event Coordinator will be assigned to your event once the event has an **executed contract**. Your Event Coordinator will be available to assist you throughout the planning process and make the transition from event planning to show implementation as smooth as possible. Throughout your planning process, if you ever hesitate about which PEC team member to direct your questions to- you may always default to your Event Coordinator.
