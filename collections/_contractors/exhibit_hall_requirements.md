- The Event Coordinator submits the floor plan to the Fire Marshal for approval. It is best to submit a plan for review before booths are sold in an effort to avoid costly changes involving exhibits.
- Covered exhibits and multi-level exhibits require Department approval.
- A “to scale” exhibit floor plan is required and must include the name, dates and location of the event, as well as, the initial draft and revision date(s) of the plan.
- Allow access to all exits, fire house cabinets, fire alarm pull stations and rest rooms.
- Minimum aisle space required is ten (10’) feet.
- Cylinders of compressed gases require approval by the Fire Marshal. Cylinders must be secured in an upright position at all times.
- All equipment, materials, and props brought in must have a Fire Marshal approved flammability rating.
- Exit signs must be visible at all times. Additional exit signs must be provided by the client or GSC if building signs are obscured by drape or booth signage
