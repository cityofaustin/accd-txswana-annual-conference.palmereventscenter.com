- The Palmer Events Center has one parking garage located next to the Palmer Events Center. The garage has two entrances with the main one on Barton Springs (across from Black’s BBQ) and the second entrance is on Riverside (next to the Long Center).
- For Clients looking to purchase parking for staff, attendees, exhibitors or vendors, the Palmer Events Center has a QR Code system. The QR codes will be given in email format unless otherwise requested. These will be scanned upon exit and each scan will be charged to the master account. Please contact your Event Coordinator for more information or to request a QR Code.
- Exhibitors or vendors can park in the service yard as long as there is space available. When the service yard is full, overflow parking goes into the garage. Those included in the overflow should expect to pay $8 (or a special event rate) to park. Rules may vary slightly depending on the event.
- More Parking Information and Policies can be found in our [Operational Policy](https://ops.palmereventscenter.com/parking_and_shuttles)
