### Outside Catering

A twenty (20%) catering fee is assessed on the net value of any food and beverage provided by an entity other than the in-house food and beverage provider. The fee is based on the assessed retail value or comparable services in a convention center or like facility. The entity providing the food must enter into an outside caterer’s agreement and comply with the terms therein.
